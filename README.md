# Housing-Price-Prediction--Machine-Learning
Different Machine Learning techniques which are already exists in the market for predicting Housing Prices. I have studied multiple papers and research work done in this field and then tried and implemented various algorithms to achieve maximum accuracy in predicting the Housing Prices. I used MSE(Mean Square Error) to predict the accuracy of different models used and drew a conclusion that applying Random Forest algorithm works best for predicting Housing Prices.
You can import the dataset from sklearn or even upload from the same dataset that I have provided in the Dataset Folder.
