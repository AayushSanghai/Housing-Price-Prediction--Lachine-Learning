# Housing-Price-Prediction--Lachine-Learning
This repository contains a study on different Machine Learning techniques which are already there in the market for predicting Housing Prices. I have studies multiple papers and research and used MSE(Mean Square Error) to predict the accuracy of different models used.
You can import the dataset from sklearn or even upload from the same dataset that I have provided in the Dataset Folder.
